# ðŸ‘‹ Baseline.Validate

> This repository has been archived. Whilst there were grand plans for it initially, you're probably better off with one of the many existing validation libraries out there or just writing your own classes.

> Documentation remains up but not linked to on the documentation website.

Minimal, magic free, configuration over convention validation constructs for modern .NET projects.

```csharp
public class UserRequestValidator : SyncValidator<UserRequest>
{
    public override ValidationResult Validate(UserRequest toValidate)
    {
        if (toValidate == null)
        {
            return FailureFor("request", ":parameter was not sent.");
        }

        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(toValidate.Name))
        {
            return FailureFor(tv => tv.Name, ":parameter is required.");
        }
    }
}

// ...

new UserRequestValidator().Validate(userRequest);
```
